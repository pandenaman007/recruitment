## Problem Statement

You are part of a startup that is building an app to allow people to find and join sports games near them. (for example - it helps find all football games happening within 3kms of your home at various grounds, and lists the players and how many spots left).

For this startup, answer **any one** of the following problem statements with a slide deck and a one-minute video of your analysis.

1. How would you plan to get the first 10, 100 & 1000 users on this app? (one plan/strategy for each)
2. Identify the competitors in this space (in India) and give 3 suggestions to help this startup beat the competition. (find out what doesn't work in existing solutions and try to fix it)
3. List out 3 major potential issues with the app which could lead the concept to fail and your solution for each of them. (ex: not enough players nearby, solution is by increasing radius)

While answering any one problem statement above, keep in mind :

-   All suggestions must work for the Indian market. Take Bengaluru as an example.
-   All suggestions must be backed by strong logic. You are free to use ChatGPT to ideate solutions but must be able to answer why you chose that solution.
-   All suggestions must bear in mind that this is a startup and will not have the resources of a big company. Make sure your solutions are feasible.
-   In case you are suggesting a solution that requires a lot of resources, mention a feasible plan to get those resources too (partnerships etc)

## Requirements

-   You are required to prepare a slide deck not exceeding 6 slides.
-   You are required to record a 1-minute video of yourself presenting your slide deck and explaining your solution.
-   You are required to upload your video to your personal Google Drive folder. The link to the video must be uploaded to the Google Form.
