## Instructions and Requirements

You will be developing a portfolio website for yourself.

-   The website should be developed using ReactJS. You are free to use any libraries and modules that you find suitable for the task. However, the frontend must be built using function-based components (class-based components are not allowed).
-   You are free to use any CSS framework of your choice.
-   Ensure good and correct usage of React hooks.
-   You should deploy the website to a hosting platform of your choice.
-   Your project's repository should include a README.md file with instructions to run the development server locally, along with well-written documentation.
-   The final code must be uploaded to your personal GitHub repository.
-   **The GitHub repository must be set as private until the deadline. Once the deadline has passed, you must make it public so that we can evaluate your solution.**

## Functionality Specifications

-   The design for the website is available on Figma. You can access it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ANSunIiOfwqjR3jeFnOJXs/Frontend-Test?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=AeJto5r1xbQjHwWR-0).
-   It is a single page website and non-scrollable.
-   In the Figma file provided, you can see that there are two themes: light and dark. You are required to implement at least one of the themes. Bonus points will be awarded if you implement both themes.
-   The website contains the following sections:
    -   Introduction: This section consists of your name, your current title/position/designation, a picture of yourself, and a short introduction about yourself.
    -   Contact and Links: This section includes your contact information, such as your phone number, email address, LinkedIn profile link, and GitHub profile link. You have the flexibility to replace any of these links with alternative options like your personal website or Twitter profile. However, please note that your phone number must remain included and cannot be removed. In case you don't have specific links, you can provide placeholder values.
    -   Experience: This section represents your work experience. For the purpose of this test, you can provide dummy values and information if you don't have relevant work experience. Please note that the content you write will not be evaluated. Instead, your grading will be based on the accuracy of your design implementation. Each of the `experience dots` in the provided Figma file is associated with a job information modal. The modal comprises three parts: Company Name, Job Description, and Company Logo.
    -   Skills: This section showcases your skills. For this test, you are free to include fictitious skills as the content will not be evaluated. However, ensure that there are at least four skills, and at most eight skills listed. You can hardcode the skills in the design implementation. Additionally, the skill proficiency values displayed in the skill proficiency bars can also be hardcoded. It is important to note that each skill proficiency value should be unique and different from one another.
    -   Hobbies: This section highlights your hobbies. You are required to include at least one hobby, but no more than three hobbies. These hobbies are user-input values, allowing you to personalize and customize them. The hobby fields should be editable, allowing users to modify the hobbies if desired. Additionally, the design includes the functionality to delete hobbies, as demonstrated in the provided Figma design. **The changes made by the user in this section should persist even after refreshing the page.**
    -   Languages: This section is similar to the hobbies section but focuses on languages. The same guidelines and rules as the hobbies section apply here as well. You should include at least one language and a maximum of three languages. Similar to the hobbies section, the language fields should be editable and deletable, following the design specifications provided in the Figma file. Ensure accurate implementation of the editable and deletable features for the language fields, maintaining consistency with the overall design and functionality. **The changes made by the user in this section should persist even after refreshing the page.**
-   Refer to the comments on the Figma file for additional details.
-   The same rules apply for both the themes.
-   Minor variations from the provided design are acceptable, but it is important to document and explain the reasoning behind your decisions. Please provide a brief explanation of why you chose to deviate from the original design, highlighting how your modifications enhance the user experience, improve functionality, or better align with the project requirements. Clear communication of your decision-making process is appreciated and will be considered during the evaluation.

## Additional Information:

-   Feel free to incorporate any additional features or techniques that you think will enhance your solution and showcase your skills effectively. Make sure to document them in your README.md file.
-   Feel free to utilize resources such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, online courses, documentation, and other reference materials to assist you in solving the problem statements.
-   However, please note that while using online resources is encouraged, directly copying code from others, including your friends, is considered unethical and not allowed.
